# Regex Tutorial: Understanding Regular Expressions

Regular expressions, or regex, are an incredibly powerful tool used for pattern matching and text processing. In this tutorial, we'll break down the components of a regex pattern and explain how each part works. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of how to construct and interpret regex patterns for a variety of uses.

## Summary

We'll explore the regex pattern `^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$`, which is commonly used to validate email addresses. We'll go through each part of the regex and explain its role in the overall pattern.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are used to specify the position in the string. The `^` symbol asserts the position at the start of the string, and the `$` symbol asserts the position at the end of the string.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers define the number of times a character, group, or character class must occur. For example, `+` matches one or more times, `*` matches zero or more times, and `{n,m}` matches between n and m times.

### OR Operator

The OR operator `|` allows for a choice between different patterns. For example, `a|b` matches either `a` or `b`.

### Character Classes

Character classes match any one of the characters inside the brackets. For instance, `[a-z0-9]` matches any lowercase letter or digit.

### Flags

Flags are used to change how the regex pattern is interpreted. Common flags include `i` for case-insensitive matching and `g` for global matching (finding all matches).

### Grouping and Capturing

Parentheses `()` are used to group parts of the regex pattern and capture the matched substrings for use later.

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions `[ ]` define a set of characters to match. For example, `[a-z]` matches any lowercase letter from a to z.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

Greedy matching tries to match as much text as possible, while lazy matching (denoted by `?`) tries to match as little text as possible. For example, `.*` is greedy, while `.*?` is lazy.

### Boundaries

Boundaries like `\b` match the position between a word and a non-word character. For instance, `\bword\b` matches "word" as a whole word.

### Back-references

Back-references refer to previously captured groups within the same regex pattern. For example, `(\d)\1` matches two consecutive identical digits.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Look-ahead `(?=...)` and look-behind `(?<=...)` are used to assert that a certain pattern follows or precedes the current position without including it in the match.
